This project deals with providing interactive learning when it comes to language classes. 
From our previous experience, we have learnt that there is so much more to language which 
we are not able to do.
It is important to have as much interaction possible for the application. So, we have designed a MVP for interactive learning.

During the course of a day at `DisruptBerlin Hackathon`, we have transitioned from `ideation` phase to a `prototype`. Obviously, there is huge possibility of improvements and we are eying on on improving this `prototype` further.


## Prototype

### Available features
The target for the app is to have a B2B platform. We intend to design it in a way that language school and classes can use the app.

- Teacher will add the students to the course, once we have the email from the teacher, students are enrolled to course.
- Teacher can create the assignment which is visible to all student. Another available feature here is that teacher gives mandatory `keywords` to use in the assignment for students to submit it.
- The basic idea behind `keywords` is to increase language vocabulary of students.
- Student can submit the assignment with keywords in as `post`.
- You can see the `posts` by other students and comment on those `posts` in the same `language`.
- You as a student can also give reactions such as `amazing`,`well-written`,`hilarious`.

### Future features

- Students with higher language knowledge will do Peer review of students with lower proficiency. Eg- German b1 student will do review of 
German A2 students' `posts` and improve it.
- Students can also choose to talk to other student by meeting with students who are close to them in location.
- Providing sentimental analysis of the text by using NLP so that student get interactive analysis.
- More features to come.
